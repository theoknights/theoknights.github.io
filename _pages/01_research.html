  <div class="collapsed"><p>"This weighty volume, entitled <i>An Ottoman Cosmography</i>, represents the culmination of a decade long collaborative effort to render Kātib Çelebi’s Ottoman Turkish <i>Cihānnümā</i> into English, one of the most influential Ottoman geographic works by perhaps the Empire’s best-known scholar. It is, as Gottfried Hagen reminds us in his introduction, the first full translation of this important text into a western language, as well as the first English translation of any work by Kātib Çelebi since Geoffrey Lewis published his <i>Mīzānü’l-ḥaḳḳ fī iḫtiyāri’l-aḥaḳḳ</i> as <i>The Balance of Truth</i> in 1957."</p></div>
