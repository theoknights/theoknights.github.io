<h3>A NELC Geneology</h3>
This page was inspired by the now defunct <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20160309103012/https://modern-tabaqat.wikia.com/wiki/Modern_Tabaqat_Wikia'>Modern Tabaqat Wikia</a> and the Academic Family Tree project, to create a visual representation of academic lineages in Middle Eastern and particularly Ottoman studies.   
<br>
<h4>A Note on Methodology</h4>
<br>
The basis of the data presented here was scraped from the Modern Tabaqat Wikia and supplemented with information drawn from the University of Chicago's NELC Department website my own research into the Ottomanists at one time affiliated with it. It therefore contains an undeniable bias towards individuals educated or working in Euro-American academic insitutions, especially UChicago, and towards Ottoman historians. While I've done my best to correct mistakes introduced when scraping the html undoubtedly some persist, please excuse any errors. 
<br>
For the sake of visual clarity, for students graduating in the last five (or so) decades, where a good deal of information is avaliable online or via ProQuest, links are mostly shown between an advisee and those individuals identified as their primary PhD advisor(s). For earlier advisees I have taken a laxer approach to intellectual geneology  including any individuals identified as important educators in their lives whether by festschrifts or biographical articles.
<br>
All this said, I think a lot of interesting and suprising connections <code>&#8212;</code> and perhaps even intellectual debts or affinities <code>&#8212;</code> are revealed by looking at a visual representation of these relationships. The full visualization of the data is a bit unweildy so I focus here on a few of the more interesting UChicago academic lineages. However, the full geneological tree is avaliable in a word searchable <a href="{{ site.url }}/pdfs/tabaqatbest.pdf">pdf</a> and also as an interactive display at the bottom of the page (NB: You will likely need to refresh the page at least once to get it to appear).
