  <p><i>This paper traces what I term a “spirit of godfearingness” present in Late Antique Christianity and Judaism, a spirit I argue we must consider as the backdrop into which Islam emerged in the 7th century AD. I examine calls during the Prophet Muhammad’s prophetic career for the Jews of Medina to “have taqwā of God and submit to Islam,” situating these in conversation with the prominent Syriac Christian term deḥltā and biblical Hebrew term yirah, both of which signify a complex admixture of fear of God and piety. Against this conceptual backdrop, I trace the linguistic meaning of taqwā, drawing on a wide range of sources from the pre-Islamic Arabian to Umayyad periods. Through this analysis, we are able to draw distinctions between the alternatively material/physical and abstract moral senses of taqwā in the pre-Islamic period and its ubiquitously religious usages very early in Muhammad’s prophetic career. The presentation highlights the possibility of thinking about understandings of being godfearing in the Late Antique moment that at once point to distinct genealogies, practices, and commitments and shared prioritization of a pious sense of fear before God. Rarely considered together, the very presence of a spirit of godfearingness across Christianity, Judaism, and Islam at the advent of the latter illuminates a dynamic form of interaction where the boundaries of concepts were far from fixed.</i></p>

  <p><i>What can one learn about the lives of women from comments that disparage them? Early Sufi texts frequently regard women as obstacles to spiritual progress, personifying the world, corporeality, and the self as a wife’s domestic and sexual needs. Hagiographies of women saints reinforce the notion that a woman’s domestic obligations conflict with full Sufi piety. This may be most succinctly illustrated in the entry on Nusiyya bint Salmān in al-Sulamī’s Dhikr al-niswa al-mutaʿabbidāt al-ṣuffiyāt (Early Sufi Women). After giving birth, Nusiyya states, “Oh Lord! You do not see me as someone worthy of your worship. So for this you have preoccupied me with a child!” Indeed, when women are praised, it is typically for abandoning feminine obligations to “become men” (as when ʿAṭṭār praised Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya) or supporting male piety as obedient wives and mothers. It is tempting to conclude, as Sara Abdel-Latif has, that such texts show little about the actual lives of the women they chronicle, revealing instead projections of male spiritual ambitions (2022). However, following Rita Gross and Sa’diyya Shaikh, I argue that although the authors never intended it, a feminist reading of the margins of classical Sufi texts enables a reconstruction of these women’s lives to show a mystical piety that existed alongside domestic obligations rather than from transcending quotidian matters or “feminine” traits. To make this argument, this presentation uses feminist historiography to analyze classical sources including Early Sufi Women, ‘Alī Hujwīrī’s Kashf al-Maḥjūb (Uncovering the Veiled), and Aisha al-Baʾuniyya’s Sufi manual.</i></p>

  <p><i>In the early Islamic period, scholars took an active role in constructing the boundaries of belief (imān). The earliest theological (kalām) writings show the ways in which scholars of emerging and competing sects demarcated the limits of imān prior to the consolidation of Sunnī orthodoxy. My paper will look at the ways in which one such scholar, al-Ḥasan b. Muḥammad b. al- Ḥanifiyya (d. 718), erected boundaries for his theological sect, the Murjiʾites, in his Kitāb al- Irjāʾ. I will specifically examine the devices that Ibn al-Ḥanifiyya uses to accuse his theological opponents of transgressing the boundaries of imān. I will focus on his use of jāhiliyya imagery and explore the ways in which Ibn al-Ḥanifiyya invokes the soothsayers (kuhhān) and divination arrows (azlām) of al-Jāhiliyya in his argument in order to claim that his opponents were deviating from the path of Islam. By demonstrating that al-Ḥasan invokes al-Jāhiliyya in order to discredit his opponent’s theological position, I will show that such a theological move indicates an already robust negative conceptualization of religious practices from the pre-Islamic period. This contradicts Peter Webb’s typology of conceptualizations of al-Jāhiliyya in the earliest centuries of Islamic polity, which characterizes portrayals of the pre-Islamic period as overwhelmingly positive prior to the 10th century CE. Given this, my paper will situate Kitāb al- Irjāʾ within the larger discussion of boundary construction through the Jāhiliyya trope in early Islamic writings.</i></p>

  <p><i>Written by the fifteenth century poet Enveri for Mehmed II, the Destan of ‘Umur Pasha, part of the Düstūrnāme (Book of the Vizier), is a powerful epic, based on oral history, of the eponymous Turkic prince of Aydın (c. 1309-1348). This long-neglected text rediscovered in the twentieth century, shines a light on the fragmented fourteenth century Aegean. Split asunder by the revanchist Byzantine Empire, emerging Beyliks of Aydın, Menteşe and Osmanli, Genoese & Venetian colonial holdings, Catalan mercenaries, and the surviving Frankokratia in Greece, the Aegean was nonetheless united in trans-Mediterranean trade networks, producing important goods for West European manufacturing – namely alum for colourful cloth. The only question being who would profit from its extraction and trade. Into this maelstrom the question over the sovereignty of the island of Chios (Saqiz) and Smyrna provides an interesting example of clashing universalist claims between the Byzantines (Andronicus II) and Turks (Aydınoğulları), and the mercantile interests of the Genoese (Zaccaria family). Out of this comes a contested and still unresolved historiographical debate in the twentieth century between Byzantinist Paul Lemerle and Ottomanist Halil İnalcık regarding who had sovereignty over Chios in 1327. This comes from differing interpretations of select passages from the Düstūrnāme, specifically the term illik oldu. This paper will explicate these different interpretations, but overcome them, by instead offering a meta explanation regarding the ignored fifteenth century context of the Düstūrnāme in the court of Mehmed II, and further will question what sovereignty meant in a world of interstate commerce.</i></p>

  <p><i>This paper is about vampirism and vampire-related practices in the Ottoman Empire in the early seventeenth century and aims to show how legal opinions (fatwas) stand as primary sources for the perception of vampirism through the analysis of vampire cases from Akkerman (today’s Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky in Odessa, Ukraine). My main fatwa collection is ʿAli b. ʿAbdullāh el-Aḳkirmānī’s (d. 1618) Fetāvā-yı Aḳkirmānī (1630-31 and 1642). In the provincial jurisconsult’s legal opinion collection, there are questions on dead people’s bodies and burning “primary cases” of plagues, who were called “vampires.” In the literature on vampires, people who died of diseases and became vampires are called “nachzehrer.” I argue that these cases are examples of nachzehrer in the Ottoman Empire, and through these questions in the fatwas, we can look at and enter the mental world of the early modern Ottoman peasant communities. The fatwas enlighten the relationship between beliefs about vampires and how people reacted against these supernatural beings. The fatwas on vampires and different practices villagers performed to prevent the spread of the disease uncover the relationship between beliefs about witches, phallic amulets, and diseases in villagers’ minds. These cases demonstrate that the underused provincial fatwa sources can be used as the means for discovering the embodiment of fears and provide us with ways to comprehend the vampirism beliefs and corpses and help us build connections in the Eurasian sociocultural arena thanks to the place of Akkerman in the juncture of Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

  <p><i>This paper analyzes a widely circulated yet little studied medieval Anatolian eschatological text, Sā‘atnāme, written in straightforward Turkish during the late 14th century, likely by a disciple of an obscure Sufi şeyh Hibetullah bin İbrahim. The analysis focuses on the text’s unique claim that anyone can secure a place in paradise by copying, endowing, reading, or listening to the Sā‘atnāme and taking it as the ultimate guidance for their religious practices, and explores how this claim resonated in the Turkish-speaking Muslim communities. Defining the newly emerged Turkish religious literature in medieval Anatolia as a discursive tradition and the Sā‘atnāme being a part of it, the paper thus employs a method that combines a close reading of the text and the historical context of its production. It argues that the Sā‘atnāme embodies a charisma-royal discourse stems from a major process of sanctifying God’s friends in the medieval Islamic Near East. By examining the paratextual elements in the various copies of the text, the paper proposes that charisma-royal discourse underlies the text’s distinctive claim and sustained popularity persisted until the 20th century. Sā‘atnāme functions as a relic that possesses Hibeytullah’s baraka in people’s eyes, it transforms an abstract idea to a tangible and accessible asset, transcending temporal and spatial boundaries. In contextualizing and historicizing a text that has significantly impacted the Turkish- speaking Muslim communities in Anatolia, this paper not only aims to contribute a better understanding of their acculturation to Islam but also to illuminate the enduring influence of charismatic local figures in shaping their religiosity in the longue durée.</i></p>

  <p><i>On November 15, 1937, under the lights of cars and trucks, a seventy-five-year-old man named Seyid Rıza, along with his son Resik Hüseyin and five others, was hanged in the Wheat Square (Buğday Meydanı) of Elazığ province in eastern Turkey. İhsan Sabri Çağlayangil, a prominent state official and politician who was sent there to organize the executions, witnessed Seyid Rıza’s final moments: “[Seyid Rıza] turned to me and asked: ‘Did you come from Ankara to hang me?’ We exchanged glances. ... He flashed a smile at me. ... It was cold and there was nobody around. However, Seyid Rıza addressed the silence and emptiness as if the square were full of people. ‘We are the sons of Karbala. We are blameless. It is a shame. It is cruel. It is murder!’ he said.” After decades of suppression and silence regarding Rıza’s execution and the subsequent mass state violence against the inhabitants of his hometown of Dersim and the larger Kurdish and Alevi populated regions in Eastern Anatolia, Seyid Rıza’s departing words have become slogans of justice and resistance among the Kurds and the Alevis in contemporary Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, as well as their diasporas outside the Middle East. This paper explores Seyid Rıza’s multifaceted role during the Hamidian (1876-1908), Young Turks (1908-1923), and Republican (1923-1937) regimes, examining his positions as a tribal chief, local leader, saint, resistance hero, and bandit in his time, as well as the leader of one of many Kurdish uprisings, a symbol of Alevism, and a traitor to the Turkish nation for later generations. The paper employs an interdisciplinary approach to question the myths of rebellion and resistance regarding the formation of national narratives in conventional historiography. It engages with the growing literature that focuses on the period of transition from empire to nation-state, enhancing the argument of continuity in state formation from the perspective of unexpected or otherwise forgotten historical actors whose experiences transcended temporal and geographical boundaries.</i></p>

  <p><i>This paper targets creating its own concepts against the underestimation-based meta- discourses on women’s criminal acts (especially serious offenses) and their repetition as a notion in the language of Turkish literary productions. The feminist-criminological approach will be driven to explore Ottoman women and crime relationships which have overwhelmingly depicted passive, downtrodden, and incompetent women self-defenders and victims in the published pieces of late Ottoman and early republican Turkish literature. This also resulted in having mainly two types of female delinquents’ representations victims and cruel offenders (doers) by using special formulaic languages, discourses, and repetitious vocabularies for the depiction of women criminal characters in fictional narratives. In this regard, this presentation will initially navigate the true definition of Ottoman women’s criminality and revolutionary approaches to their delinquency with feminist works that criticize the mundane discourses hiding their criminal potential regarding their motherly and nurturer positions and lower numbers in penal institutions. Not only underestimation against women’s perpetrations but also depersonalization and dehumanization by identifying them as wild tigresses, deviant witches, and cruel villains as a way of rejecting women’s criminal competency, especially in serious offenses, have overwhelmingly invaded literary works. It is crucial to note that I will provide many examples from the late Ottoman and early republican literature pieces such as The Woman with a Dagger: A Strange Story, Bloody Fairy, Grasshopper Zehra, Fox Leman, Selma and her Shadow that all will help to trace the ways of displacement of female criminals and powerful women villains with the attribution of the passive and vulnerable characteristics that enhanced the losing agency of women in fictional narrations.</i></p>

  <p><i>This research explores the work of novelist and translator Nihal Yeginobali whose literary output stretches from the 1950s to the 2000s. Though a key figure in the Turkish literary industry, Yeginobali’s female-centric novels have been forgotten commercially and ignored academically. This paper focuses on her novel Eflatun Kız (Lilac Girl) a unique case as it has been published into three different contexts as three different novels; serialized in the newspaper “Vatan” under Yeginobali’s own name as a Turkish novel in 1957; published as a best-selling American romance novel set in New Orleans in 1964, under a male pseudonym; and finally translated back into Turkish and published as a feminist, social realist work in 1988. In Yeginobali’s attempts to surmount gendered prejudices in publication; her novel transformed; changed nationalities and revealed shifts in notions of womanhood, social responsibility and sexuality throughout 20th century Turkey. Each version was published with radically different paratextual elements offering us valuable insights into apparatuses of cultural production. Yeginobali’s oeuvre not only showcases the Republic’s conflicting attempts at positioning “woman” as the locus of social change, but her experiment reveals a generative rupture from binary thinking which focuses on author/translator, foreign/local, female/male, entertainment/literature. How does a female Turkish writer become a male “American novelist”? How can “a Turkish novel” become “an American novel” in translation just seven years later? And finally, how do we account for outliers like Lilac Girl when we look for coherence and continuity in a country’s literary tradition?</i></p>

  <p><i>Released in 1994, Moufida Tlatli’s The Silences of the Palace uses the frame narrative mode of storytelling to depict a particularly painful day in the life of its 25-year-old protagonist, Alia, as she journeys back – literally and figuratively – to the kitchens and servants’ quarters of the silent and secretive palace in which she was raised, and which she fled on the eve of Tunisian independence. As a result, throughout Silences, the audience bears collective witness to multiple layers of overlapping and interconnecting representations of sexual and gender-based trauma. In Alia, the clinical manifestation of complex trauma is exceedingly apparent on the physical and the emotional levels; at the same time, Alia’s “doubly-colonized” positionality within the social hierarchy of the beys’ palace, when read against the concurrent movement for Tunisian national liberation occurring outside the palace walls, effectively highlights the intergenerational transmission of trauma and the perpetuation of gender-based violence within the context provided by the colonial condition. This paper is an interdisciplinary enumeration of and elaboration upon these aspects of the film in conversation with the fields of clinical, postcolonial, and literary trauma theory, and concludes with the assertion that the film’s final shift away from the masculine as a site of oppression and toward an acknowledgement of shared legacies of familial pain makes possible the formation of new subjectivities integral to the healing of trauma. In so doing, this work specifically seeks to foreground the role of and potential for film as a site of continued anticolonial resistance.</i></p>

  <p><i>In the mid-1900s, the first Tunisian President, reformist, and champion of the modern, Habib Bourguiba, attempted to modernize yet another area of “ignorant” tradition: the saints. Infuriated by accounts that a deviant mad Sufi saint, the majdhūb Omar al-Fayyache was appearing before women undressed, speaking in signs, and having epileptic fits, Bourguiba deemed al- Fayyache mentally unfit. He sent him to the mental hospital. Yet, as al-Fayyache’s family relayed to me, the saint’s stay was brief: the next morning, he appeared, chains still attached to his arms and legs, in the same bed he slept in each night. The saint had given the state the slip. What do saints that madden tell us about the workings of state power? How do textual and oral narratives of saints “giving the slip” (re)negotiate the dynamic of the spiritual and the political? Building on Begoña Aretxaga’s work on how state power productively fills and shapes subjects’ relations not only to political power but also everyday life (2003), Katherine Ewing’s writings on sainthood, modernity, and psychoanalysis (1997), and James Hoesterey’s scholarship on “shaming the state” (2016), my presentation examines the narratives of maddening saints. I draw on textual and ethnographic research in Morocco and Tunisia to analyze the ways in which majdhūb tales use humor, irony, and humiliation to invert the relation of saint and ruler. I argue that the (re)telling of these tales opens space of possibility for North African subjects, a way of eliding, if only temporarily, the state’s desires.</i></p>

  <p><i>In the mid-1970s the Moroccan band Ousmane (whose name means ‘lightning’) became the first group to record popular music in Tamazight, the indigenous language of North Africa. Combining local folk musics with new musical technologies and an explicit political platform of indigenous rights, the band advanced Amazigh sounds and styles as essential aspects of Moroccan national culture on vinyl records and in concert halls from Casablanca to Paris. Ousmane presented a hybrid musical genre which sought to reconcile “authentic” indigenous traditions with “modern” and “scientific” musical principles which they saw as necessary for political and social progress. In the tense cultural politics of the Years of Lead, as the repressive reign of King Hassan II was known, these questions cut to the heart of a contested Moroccan national identity. A cultural history of Ousmane puts these conflicts between official discourses and popular movements into stark relief, revealing the complex ways in which musicians navigated colonial legacies and generated modern audiences. By pairing archival sources of the Moroccan popular press of the 1970s with close listening to Ousmane’s musical output, this paper demonstrates the utility of popular music as a source for narrating subaltern history in the 20th century.</i></p>

  <p><i>In recent decades, Moroccan language policy and, by extension, its literary tradition, have been shaped by sociolinguistic tensions between the various languages and dialects spoken throughout Morocco. While Modern Standard Arabic was codified as Morocco’s national language after independence in 1956 (a decision in line with the Moroccan nationalist party’s identification with regional Arab-Islamic movements), French maintains post-colonial supremacy in the fields of business and education, while Tamazight, the language of Morocco’s indigenous Amazigh population, was finally elevated as an official national language in the 2011 constitution. Against this backdrop of fraught linguistic use and identification, some public intellectuals have begun advocating for the use of Moroccan Vernacular Arabic (Darija) as an official language in educational, economic and intellectual settings. This contention has been the center of fierce debate as, on the one hand, it represents a gateway to a unified national linguistic future while, on the other, it transgresses ideologies which date to the Arabic literary renaissance (Nahḍa) regarding the diglossic nature of the Arabic language and the unsuitability of vernacular for productive intellectual work. Situated within this debate, my presentation will explore the contemporary work of three Moroccan authors who have produced novels entirely in Darija, and interrogate the implications of their work in the Moroccan literary tradition. While these authors do not present a unified political ideology, I argue that their work demonstrates the potential of Darija in written cultural production and provides an artistic lens through which to understand the wider context of Moroccan sociolinguistics and conceptions of modernity.</i></p>

  <p><i>In the early 1750s, when the Nuruosmaniye Mosque was rising on the Istanbul skyline, Ottoman architecture was at a turning point in many respects. This building with its annexes, the first monumental edifice of the Ottoman Baroque, was designed by a Greek (Rūm) named Simeon Kalfa, the first known non-Muslim architect to build a sultanic mosque (cāmiʿ-i selāṭīn). Building secretary Ahmed Efendi’s exceptional monograph on the Nuruosmaniye1 acknowledges the role of the mosque’s architect in a context of formal and technical details. However, the work rarely mentions the distinctiveness of the architect’s design and the sources from which he took inspiration. Although the information we can obtain from various Turkish, Armenian, Greek, and even French contemporary sources mentioning him is limited, Simeon Kalfa was the first important representative of a new style that would leave its mark on Istanbul for about a hundred years. In this paper, I examine contemporary sources about Simeon Kalfa, written in the aforementioned languages and from different perspectives, and attempt to draw a picture of the Ottoman architect who gained respect beyond his own community. I also address how his non-Muslim status was treated in different sources. Secondly, I explore probable European artistic references the architect used while designing the mosque. Finally, I discuss Simeon Kalfa’s architectural legacy and starting with him, the tradition of appointing non-Muslim architects to design imperial mosques through early examples such as the rebuilt Fatih, the Selimiye of Üsküdar, and the Nusretiye. Eventually, this paper proposes a better profile for the prominent master and an idea about his artistic references.</i></p>

  <p><i>This paper is a reflection on the challenges and opportunities of applying methods of computational text analysis on Ottoman Turkish texts. I draw upon a text corpus of Ottoman court histories (Veḳayiʿnüvis tārīḫleri) from and about the long 18th century to highlight different tools and techniques necessary to study texts at a larger scale and discuss what this increase in scale contributes to Ottoman historiography. Here, scale refers to the increase in the number of documents and words that form the basis of historical analysis. Instead of studying one history or the works of one historian, I propose to study all available histories and political writings (layiha) from this period and this milieu, Ottoman scribal bureaucracy, together. Specifically, I will first discuss the steps necessary to compile text corpora such as the transformation of images of manuscripts into machine readable texts (handwritten text recognition) or the acquisition of transcriptions from existing scholarship. Then, I will briefly address the specifics of text normalization for Ottoman Turkish and the computational challenges related to working with tools originally developed for English. Finally, I will offer one example of the application of these methods, topic modelling, to demonstrate what new historical insights emerge out of reading these histories computationally. While the central aim of this paper is to reflect on methods of computational history in Middle Eastern studies, through my research I discern different discourses prevalent in Ottoman bureaucracy at the turn of the century and particularly observe how Ottomans perceived Russians and their impact on the durability of the Empire.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Safavid Empire, much like its Mughal and Ottoman contemporaries, promoted a culture of gastronomic connoisseurship, treating culinary discernment as a mark of cultivation. This approach to the culinary arts—itself in large part an evolution of ʿAbbasid and earlier norms—itself entailed a distinct approach to the labor of cooking. In this paper, I will explore Safavid cookery as a practice that cut across class lines, encompassing both professionals working in the palace kitchens and urban cookshops of Isfahan and elsewhere, as well as elites (including at least two shahs) who engaged in cookery. I propose that cookery as an elite "hobby" flourished among socially-situated practices of conviviality and adab. This approach to cookery as a practice shared between professionals and elite hobbyists may account for, or at least inform, the unusual self-depictions of two sixteenth-century professional cooks in cookbooks composed for elite audiences—a degree of artisanal subjectivity otherwise unmatched in early modern Persianate culinary literature.</i></p>

  <p><i>The term ‘Ottoman Turkish’ encompasses Turkic speech varieties of considerable diversity. Though it has received ample periodization (e.g., Kerslake (1998)), much of the classificatory complexities remain unaddressed. These issues become especially apparent from the late 15th century, where the development of a court register led to the substantial enrichment of the Turkic sociolinguistic repertoire. I argue that these difficulties stem in part from an understanding of language diversity linked to geographies and time periods across individuals, at the cost of a commensurate focus on diversity within individuals that emerge over a single lifetime. The established philological framework analyses languages across time and space. It is predicated on the assumption that an analysis of a given speech variety (or a set thereof) consists in identifying the constituent parts of its grammar and understanding them as historical reflexes of Proto-Turkic. Within this framework, speech varieties are tied to specific intervals of time and space, such that individuals and groups are treated as monoliths. The diachronic bent foregrounds a taxonomy based on history and geography at the expense of examining language diversity conditioned by social context. However, invaluable to an understanding of Ottoman Turkish is variation within these speech varieties and individuals. This provides the flexibility necessary to place varieties like ‘Court Ottoman Turkish’ which coexisted alongside vernaculars. By allowing for a sociolinguistic approach, contrastive elements of the linguistic repertoires of individuals can be categorized in the same way as would linguistic features prevailing across specific regions and time periods.</i></p>

  <p><i>In the late 19th century, amidst the Arab Nahḍa – an era of cultural and intellectual awakening in the Levant – the Antiochian and Jerusalem Orthodox Churches faced a pivotal struggle over ecclesiastical sovereignty between the Arab laity and clergy and the Greek hierarchy. (Grams, 2021 Goodgame, 2022 Robson, 2011 Vovchenko, 2013) Secular and religious leaders in Palestine-Syria championed the cause of Arabizing the Orthodox Church, giving rise to what Khalil al-Sakakini would later in 1912 call “the Orthodox Nahda”. (Dierauf, 2021) This paper examines a manuscript by Syrian-Arab Bishop Raphael Hawaweeny, written under the pseudonym Abdul Ahad al-Shafi in 1893. Entitled “The Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre: A Historical Account,” Hawaweeny’s work challenges the Greek dominance in the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem and advocates for its Localization/Arabization. Through a textual and para-textual analysis I will explicate how Hawaweeny lays his claims for indigenous spiritual authority and custodianship. I view this text as a ‘counter-history’ in that it recounts the ecclesiastical history of the reign of the Greek clergy precisely in order to deconstruct the authority of its’ ‘Universalist’ claims to sovereignty and vindicate rival claims. In analyzing these intersecting narratives, I will focus both on continuity (both apostolic and ethnic) as an organizing principle of narrativization and on territoriality as a canonical and geopolitically informed theological and national discourse on sovereignty. Locating this text within the larger literature on late ottoman reformation, and Arab revivalism allows us to further see formations of the Nahda as an ecumenical movement (Hansen and Weise, 2016 94 Makdisi, 2019: 21)</i></p>

  <p><i>Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the Cairo-based Ottoman historian and man of letters Jurji Zaydan (1861–1914) was flooded with letters from scholars and laypeople across the Muslim world. They warned the prominent founder of al-Hilal against writing Islamic history within the narrative form of the modern Arabic novel. Zaydan, being of a Syrian Orthodox working-class background and committed to the equality of Ottoman religious and ethnic communities, argued that it was impossible for him to abandon the writing Islamic history in the form of a novel. Instead, he continued to write a total of 22 novels that were widely read and translated, and which he promoted as works of history under the title “The History of Islam Series.” Public debates around Zaydan’s work formed an integral part of Arabic intellectual discourses on who could write and make claims over the historical record. Contemporary engagement with Zaydan’s unique project highlights the uniqueness of his intervention in harnessing the Islamic past to affect socio-political change in his Ottoman present. Zaydan’s rich and contentious historical novels, and the public debates surrounding their production, provide a glimpse into the intellectual, social, and political struggle for reform that shaped his generation. His novels shed new light on the nahḍa, whose popular productions have often been ignored in favor of “high” literature and scholarship. This paper examines how Zaydan’s project of rendering Islamic history within a fictionalized narrative form challenged axiomatic Islamic epistemologies of history as part of the Islamic sciences and negotiated a non-sectarian reformist vision grounded in Ottomanism.

  <p><i>My paper explores a series of attempts to romanize the Arabic language in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Egypt and situates them within a global history of script reforms and nation building efforts in the modern period. In the first part of the paper, I discuss the virtually unexplored models to write Arabic in the Latin script developed by the Cairo-based magazine al-Muqtataf between 1889 and 1897, relating them to the responses they elicited from the magazine's readers and some of the romanization practices found in advertising, commercial displays in the streets, and governance at the time. I demonstrate that, in this period, romanized Arabic was envisioned as an original way to pursue financial profit and technological efficiency, confront European knowledge production, and redefine the standing of Arabic within transregional publishing networks that encompassed different languages and alphabets. I thus offer an alternative geography of script reform that supersedes the national framework. In the second part of the paper, I follow the history of romanization in Egypt in the 1930s and 1940s. I focus on a series of short-lived proposals, in particular the one advanced by ʿAbd al-ʿAziz Fahmi (1870-1951) to the Egyptian Language Academy (established in 1936), to write the Arabic language using the Latin script. I argue that differently from the case of al-Muqtataf, these later instances of romanization were part of nationalist and state building efforts that focused on the national space of Egypt, rather than on the transregional dimension of publishing networks and cross-linguistic knowledge production.

  <p><i>This paper will focus on the most famous work by nineteenth-century Nahḍa figure Nāṣīf al-Yāzijī (b.1800, d.1871), his 1855 maqāmāt collection The Meeting of the Two Seas (Majmaʿ al-baḥrayn). In Majmaʿ, al-Yāzijī closely emulated—but adapted—the classical maqāma collection by al-Ḥarīrī of Basra (d.1122). Though credited as a major figure in Arabic’s revival in the nineteenth century, al-Yāzijī has been neglected by many scholars of the Nahḍa, who tended to define the period mainly through Arab intellectuals’ contact with the West and their adoption of European literary models. My approach to the literary culture of the period seeks a different route: rather than view al-Yāzijī’s work as a close emulation of al-Ḥarīrī’s classical model, I locate al-Yāzijī’s project at a cultural moment premised on return to, or (re)encounter with, indigenous forms of Arabic literary art. My study of al-Yāzijī’s Majmaʿ traces the ways in which the maqāmāt stories reflect critically on the return to classics that the rise of printing technologies during the period enabled, which in effect prioritized visuality and seeing as sources of truth and modes of knowledge-seeking. In my reading of Majmaʿ, I examine how the work engages side by side the sonic and the visual, the oral/aural and the written to show that the standard(ized) forms printed texts alone provide leaves off multitudes of meaning, which the aural experience of the language may recover. Ultimately, the study seeks to explore al-Yāzijī’s take on Arabic’s heteroglossic condition, in which varieties of the spoken registers and a standard written form exist distinctly within the language.</i></p>

  <p><i>This article discusses the transformations of controlling crime and deviance in Egypt under British rule from 1882 to 1922. It aims to place the occupation of Egypt in the context of criminology to reveal as much as invading Egypt was on a broader capitalist project; it was also implicated in a criminology project. It relies on two main strands of scholarship: It refers to the histories of emerging capitalism in the Global South, which initiated integration into the global market through unequal trade deals and military force, leading to an “informal empire.” Then, it attends to the studies on the appropriation of law under the guise of “civilizing mission,” which convoluted occupying Egypt with lines of race and empire. Drawing on sociological theories of crime, it asks how the punitive practices of controlling populations related to the context of developing global markets under colonial conditions in Egypt. It adds how the system of policing and prisoning related to the control of finances and agriculture production in Egypt. How did the idea of order and control of crime form a part of British rule? Against this theoretical backdrop, it is argued that the integration into the global market and the “coloniality of law” went hand in hand with a patch of disciplinary practices to guarantee the management of labor and the extraction of resources. Informed by what Biko Agozino (2003) terms Counter Colonial Criminology, it shows that the interplay of colonial bureaucracy and the processes of exploitation of resources were facilitated by the practices of control and punishment that formed in three main areas: agricultural production infrastructure, policing, and bureaucracy.</i></p>

  <p><i>This paper explores the interconnectedness of entomology, apiculture, and the early 20th-century formation of the Egyptian nation-state. It delves into the pivotal role played by scientific knowledge about nature and technological advancements in beekeeping, investigating how this intersection influenced economic, political, and scientific interests. Grounded in a Marxist understanding of the materiality of the nation, the paper scrutinizes the establishment of beekeeping as a pivotal industry in capitalist development. The chief protagonist in this narrative is the Egyptian bacteriologist Ahmed Zaki Abu Shadi (1892-1955), an established authority figure on beekeeping. By examining global entomological networks, the analysis goes beyond a local context, shedding light on Abu Shadi's impact on inter-national practices and the trajectory of Egypt's economy. The study reveals the intricate relationship between entomology, capitalism, and nation-building, emphasizing that the bee is not merely a metaphor but a tangible artifact central to the political economy of Egypt's modern development.</i></p>

  <p><i>The history of modern Egypt is rife with recurrent and unrelenting sex panics. These recursive historical events, which have a rhythm and structure to them, involve forms of incitement and state violence against sexual subalterns. They comprise discourses and practices of demonization targeting queer populations, “licentious women,” and sex workers, whom are invariably painted as invaders tearing apart at the fabric of the nation, defacing its moral principles, offending religion, and even colluding with imperialist powers. Employing novel approaches within the history of sexuality and materialist queer analysis, this paper explores the structural underpinnings of these panics from a lens which situates them within the longue durée historical transformations involving sexuality, the family, and the state. Based on archival research and ethnographic study of queer politics in Egypt, this paper presents an alternative to dominant approaches to the study of sexuality in the Arab world. In mounting a trenchant critique of culturalist frameworks, it lays bare the nominalism through which the sexual question has been generally understood. As such, it particularly takes its analytical cue from the ways in which sexual subalternity–from the early years of Egyptian independence from colonial rule– has been legally criminalized under the rubric of “prostitution,” and not “homosexuality” as such. As a remnant of the nationalist movement against licensed sex work during the interwar period, the question of “prostitution” haunts the social and political domains in contemporary Egypt. Thus, it undergirds phenomena from raids on bathhouses in Cairo to gendered reproaches of women’s participation in the public sphere. This paper theorizes the uses of this floating signifier of “prostitution” by observing the ways in which it has come to frame sexual subalterns as personifications of the moral excesses of capitalism. It aims to interrogate this fetishistic conception of sexuality, and the attendant panics it generates, by analyzing its conditions of possibility.</i></p>

This paper hones in on the metamorphosis of speculative capital, from the shackles of public debt to the liquidity of cash profits, facilitated by the imperial machinery of the Caise de la Dette Publique. I contend that the Caisse, in this period, was an agent of meticulously crafted austerity measures, aiming to reroute the financial lifelines from Egypt’s rail arteries directly into the coffers of European claimants. By paying special attention to impactful and profound engineering scars left by the Caisse’s relentless extraction of profit, this paper uncovers a stark nexus between imperial mandates and infrastructural exhaustion. Moreover, I posit that acts of pilfering and skullduggery, though perhaps unpremeditated, emerged as a deliberate transgression, or at times rebellion, against the global tide of predatory capitalism. This narrative not only chronicles a tale of local decline, but also illuminates the silent, yet potent, undercurrents of local resistance that refused to succumb to wear and tear.</i></p>

  <p><i>This paper explores the crucial yet often overlooked role of the Amiras, a group of Armenian bankers based in Istanbul, within the Ottoman state from the late eighteenth to the mid- nineteenth century. Despite being barred from wielding formal political power, the Amiras were pivotal in the functioning and exercise of state power, particularly evident until the onset of the Tanzimat era. Through their involvement in strengthening the economy and financing state policies, the Amiras emerged as indispensable actors in the Ottoman state apparatus. Through the case of the Düzyans, an Amira family that controlled the Imperial Mint, Darbhâne-i  mire, this paper analyzes how their influence extended beyond the mint to encompass broader imperial society, governance, and economy, particularly in managing the Sultan’s finances. The control of the Imperial Mint, a symbol of economic prestige in the Ottoman Empire, underscores the significant position held by the Düzyan family and, by extension, the Amiras within the Ottoman hierarchical structure. This paper employs the narrative surrounding the Amiras and the specific example of the Düzyan family to challenge the conventional narrative of imperial governance. It argues for a re-evaluation of the influence of Armenian elites within the fabric of imperial governance. Through the Düzyan case, the paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of power, economy, and governance in the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire, highlighting the role played by ethno-religious minorities in the shaping of imperial policies and practices.</i></p>

  <p><i>In the last decade, historiography has copiously documented instances of violence in the Ottoman Empire’s final years. Indeed, we have reached a point in which what has been less accounted for is the absence of violence. This paper offers an examination of the absence of violence. It begins, curiously enough, with sex in a bathhouse. At night on February 25, 1911, three Armenian and two Greek men who resided in the town of Adapazarı, located in north-western Turkey (connected to the sanjak of İzmit in the Ottoman Empire), were caught having sex with a Bosniak (Boşnak) Muslim prostitute in a bathhouse and brought into police custody. Thereupon, Hüseyin Sırrı Bey, the district governor of Adapazarı, gave a political character to this incident—in light of the Adana Massacre of 1909—in order to have them be imprisoned, put on trial before the judge and be condemned. Through this particular event, this paper examines why intercommunal killings happen in some situations, but not in others. It argues that with careful microhistorical research it is possible to reveal certain local factors that lead to restraint. It also shows likelihood of idea of Ottoman unity (İttihad-ı Anasır) between Ottoman Muslim and non- Muslim communities in a borderland region to the Balkans as well as exploring political space for negotiations among local actors. Through microhistory and sociolegal analysis, I employ this specific adultery event to understand state-society relations within the late Ottoman context.</i></p>

  <p><i>The writing of intellectual biographies of Ottoman reformers is an area that runs almost parallel to the writing of ulema families’ careers, and the writing of politico-economical networks Ottoman pashas establish locally and internationally. These histories nevertheless open windows into larger pre-modern and modern histories as they explain milieus, offer nuanced views or to challenge the existing scholarship. An intellectual biography of Hovsep Vartanyan (1815-1879) is liminal as it stands between histories of Ottoman reformers of the Tanzimat who are litterateur-bureaucrats, and histories of non-Muslim Ottoman pashas who are multilingual deal-brokers. Vartanyan earns the title of a pasha after 20 years of employment at the Ottoman navy as a first translator at a moment when the title first becomes available to those from non-military backgrounds. His literary production as an author and as a translator is not only instructive (as in writing about Napoleon or telegraph) but also reconciling (as in trying to bridge the Catholic and Apostolic Armenian millets through romance as a literary genre). His writing on constitutionalism, his membership in the Ottoman scientific society (Encümen- i Daniş), and his publication of periodicals for over two decades force us to analyze his intellectual output in Armeno-Turkish and Armenian, situate him among his contemporaries (such as Şinasi, Ahmed Vefik, Ahmed Cevdet, Ahundzade, Malkum Khan and Bogos Nubar) and revisit categories as such litterateur-bureaucrat, reformer-pasha, and Ottoman-Armenian.</i></p>

  <p><i>My paper demonstrates how denaturalization and surveillance methods devised to control mobility, including a photographic repository, were a crucial part of a broad repertoire of state violence aimed at Ottoman Armenian transatlantic migrants. I focus on the Hamidian era – the reign of Sultan Abdülhamid II (1876- 1909) – and how empire-wide bureaucratic networks collaborated to label Armenians as undesirable subjects and prevent migrants’ return to the empire. The anxieties of the government about growing Armenian nationalism, which could the Great Powers support, fueled discriminatory policies that transformed a labor migration into an exile. Unpacking this history helps to resituate the bureaucratic tools the government of Abdülhamid II used to single out Armenians, which accompanied other forms of violence, such as massacres. Reconstructing late Ottoman policies of denaturalization that started in 1896, this paper asks the question of how becoming Ottoman was informed by perceptions of governability and malleability, and how Ottoman subjecthood was made and unmade at the end of the empire. As the work of historians on Greater Syrian migration has shown, in contrast to the policies towards Armenians, the Hamidian administration actively encouraged Syrian and Lebanese transatlantic migrants to keep their Ottoman subjecthood and return to the empire. Although statelessness has been associated with the inability of minorities to acquire citizenship in the post-imperial successor states, the Ottoman Empire had already stripped a marginalized ethnoreligious community of its nationality. Denaturalization, I argue, became the precursor of more standardized border- building and mobility policing projects in post-Ottoman states, such as the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923.</i></p>

  <p><i>The structural disintegration of Palestinian existence by the Zionist project since 1948 perpetually ruptures the collective Palestinian consciousness, generating fragmented conditions of Palestinian reality which rapidly evolve across generational and geographic contexts. The Israeli Nakba canon operates to dismantle the Palestinian collective by manufacturing violence which penetrates and disrupts every extension of Palestinian being. In pursuit of liberation, the Palestinian people require a globally accessible landscape which transcends the nation-state to consider the various contexts of occupation and their respective demands for freedom. The Homeland is Us argues that this space, one frequently alluded to by various scholars of the Palestinian question, can be identified as the Palestinian imaginal. The imaginal realm, or Mundus Imaginalis, in this case is adopted from Islamic theosophy and reconceived as a mode of Palestinian landscape which generates access to a unified homeland concealed by violent occupation. The imaginal is evaluated through its relationship with the Palestinian novel as a critical informant on the diverse Palestinian condition, reconceptualizing the tangibility of liberation within and beyond the boundaries of occupied land via expanded knowledge on the heterogenous Palestinian reality.

  <p><i>During Ottoman Palestine’s finalizing decades, the first Zionist Aliyot (1881-1914) introduced labor-focused and self-sufficient settlements emphasizing land and agricultural ownership. Distinct from the previous Old Yishuv, Zionist migrations comparatively lacked religious motivations and generally rejected economic co-dependencies developed from cohabitation with native populations, conveying Zionist migrations’ economically and politically independent approaches and goals. This analysis strives to provide primary sources presenting subaltern Palestinian responses to the emergence of the New Yishuv and secondary sources surveying these first-hand accounts as well as other material pertaining to this topic. Particularly focusing on sources related to petitions submitted by the Fellahin and Bedu to Istanbul, this paper will showcase the changing relationships between rural Palestinian communities and Zionist settlers of the First and Second Aliyot as well as Jews generally. A part of numerous disputes between the two respective parties, these petitions also offer insights into the interpersonal and communal conflicts that would greatly shift from inter-community resource clashes to rising binational struggles. Providing an approach that situates rural intercommunal conflict and the burgeoning nationalization of Arab and Palestinian identity among Arab elites as codependent events in the formation of Palestinian awareness, fear, and rejection of Zionism. In addition to reexamining scholarly prevalent conclusions that place early Arabist thought among Palestinian largely urban elite and intellectual communities as virtually the earliest clear indications of an anti-Zionist movement despite the preceding early Arab rural encounters against Zionism.</i></p>

  <p><i>This study, rooted in sociological inquiry and leveraging interview transcripts and data from a previous research project, seeks to meticulously document Afghanistan's historical entanglements with external forces since the 19th century, culminating in the pivotal fall of Kabul in 2021. By incorporating life history interviews, it aims to weave a contemporary narrative that situates Afghanistan's protracted geopolitical engagements within the expansive tapestry of global power dynamics. This research endeavors to dissect the intricate socio-political effects of these interactions on Afghan society, offering an in-depth understanding of the interplay between international influences and local realities. The intention is to augment existing scholarship by harmonizing microhistorical personal narratives with the broader trajectory of foreign interventions in Afghanistan. Central to this study is the exploration of the recurring theme of external exploitation and its profound impact on Afghanistan's socio-political fabric. The research culminates in a contention that enduring foreign interference has significantly shaped Afghanistan's modern history and fostered a cycle of instability, exemplified by the disorderly withdrawal of U.S. forces. This investigation into Afghanistan's geopolitical role and the ensuing challenges confronting Afghan communities—both within the country and in diaspora—profoundly enriches our understanding of Afghanistan’s complex position in global politics. It casts light on the multifaceted consequences of geopolitical strategies on individual lives, critiquing the often-overlooked effects of major power narratives on everyday existence. These findings underscore the imperative for a more sophisticated, informed approach in international policy formulation concerning Afghanistan, one that is cognizant of the varied experiences of Afghans both at home and abroad, and geared towards addressing the diverse and complex nature of their challenges and aspirations. The study highlights the critical need for integrating microhistorical insights into broader geopolitical frameworks to develop policies that are not only effective but also compassionate towards the human aspects of international relations.</i></p>

  <p><i>Throughout history, the success of social movements has hinged upon the ability to garner widespread support through a shared sentiment that can be effectively communicated both internally and externally. This paper explores the intersection of joy, resistance, and human rights in the context of contemporary Iranian society. While prior research has inquired into various art forms as conduits for protest and social change in both pre and post-revolutionary Iran, this study focuses on joy itself as a collective act of resistance against an autocratic regime. Through a nuanced analysis of video footage, slogans, dances, poems, and speeches from recent protests, specifically the Woman Life Freedom movement, this study seeks to understand joy as the dynamic force behind the "life" in the movement's slogan. Through theories of social interaction and social construction, this paper contends that joy, when denied through bans, denigration, or economic means, acts as a method of dehumanization. In such cases, the courage to reclaim joy emerges as a tool for pushing back against dehumanization and affirming the humanity and agency of the oppressed population. This paper provides a unique perspective on the complexities of joy and positions it not only as a form of resistance but also as a powerful connector that fosters a sense of national intimacy among Iranians and inspires connections that transcend boundaries and contribute to the collective resilience of a people.</i></p>

  <p><i>This project seeks to explore the land conflicts between Muslims and Armenians in the “Six Provinces” (Vilāyāt-ı Sitte) in 1908-1914. After the revolution in 1908, the Armenians who returned to the Ottoman Empire from abroad initiated campaigns to assert possession claims over land usurped by Kurdish tribal heads. Disputes led to violent crashes between ethnic groups, which presented one of the most severe problems during this era. While numerous works on events in 1915 have mentioned land conflicts as an important background, there are few specific studies on this topic. This project aims to fill this gap. This project aims to examine the policies taken by the Ottoman central government, the effects of these policies, and the reasons behind the government’s inability to resolve the disputes. The Ottoman government opted to employ a combination of administrative arbitration through Councils of Administration (Meclis-i İdāre) and adjudication in administrative (niẓāmiye) courts. These frequent changes created confusion among officials. In addition, in the Six Provinces where the authority of government was weak, the Ottoman central government on one hand suffered from a lack of an effective land administration system, on the other hand, the government aimed to secure the support of Kurdish tribal leaders. Consequently, the Ottoman central government reached a compromise with the Kurdish tribal leaders, refraining from returning most of the usurped lands. In the end, the land conflicts remained unresolved. By examining the interactions between the Ottoman central government, Kurdish tribes, Armenians, and other stakeholders, this article illustrates how these interactions defined the outcoming of land conflicts in the periphery of an empire in decline.</i></p>

  <p><i>In 1913, the Basra newspaper al-Dastur published a poem praising shaykh Mubarak al-Sabah for his devotion to the Ottoman state: “long live Arab magnanimity / long live Islamic zeal / his excellency Mubarak Basha al-Sabah / supports the state of the caliphate.” 1 But most historical writing on Mubarak, drawing largely on British archival material, dismisses his claims to Ottoman-ness – and Ottoman claims to Kuwait – as mere posturing. This paper instead takes seriously the protestations of Mubarak and other Ottoman Arab elites in Basra and Kuwait that they were Ottoman. It asks, what did these men mean by “Ottoman”? The paper reads petitions from Basra and Kuwait alongside newspaper coverage of the Gulf in al- Dastur. Focusing on petitions written by Mubarak al-Sabah, and newspaper coverage of him, the paper explores how the shaykh envisioned his relationship to the Ottoman state and the place of Ottoman sovereignty in Kuwait. It examines how Ottoman officials in the center reinterpreted Mubarak’s claims through translation; and explores how Basra intellectuals outlined the conceptual and geographical boundaries of the Ottoman, especially with regard to Mubarak. I argue that elites in the Gulf were invested in what it meant to be “Ottoman” because they assumed the future would be Ottoman, and wanted to shape it. Rather than assess the empire in terms of institutions or proximity to the center, then, this paper examines Ottoman-ness from the perspective of imperial subjects in and around Basra.</i></p>

  <p><i>A growing body of scholarship has reconsidered the Tanzimat (1838-76) by detailing how those on the Ottoman Empire’s margins experienced the era’s reforms. This paper builds on such work by centering nomadic pastoralists in the central Anatolian countryside. Using bureaucratic documents from the Ottoman archives, it details the 1860s transformation of the Uzunyayla region in Sivas. Uzunyayla is a highland plateau that the Avşars, a pastoralist Turkmen tribe, traditionally migrated to each summer. Nineteenth-century Ottoman reformers aimed to make rural spaces like Uzunyayla more ‘orderly’ and ‘productive’ through the sedentarization of mobile communities. Simultaneously, after the 1854-6 Crimean War, Istanbul instrumentalized the resettlement of Muslim refugees (muhacir) for state-formation. Under the terms of the 1857 Immigration Regulation and 1858 Ottoman Land Code, muhacir were given “empty land (arazi-i haliye)”—in other words, space that officials deemed to be unoccupied or agriculturally unproductive. Uzunyayla was one of the first of such purportedly empty places. Its settlement by muhacir sparked a violent conflict between the incomers and the Avşars, who had used the land for generations. This paper explores how officials suppressed the pastoralists’ resistance to state policy and coerced the community into sedentary life in the 1860s. The settlement of Uzunyayla is a fruitful case study that can strengthen our understanding of how Tanzimat-era shifts in rural governance and land administration impacted the lives of ordinary Ottoman subjects. I ultimately argue that the Ottoman state used migrant resettlement to render the Anatolian countryside legible and forcibly sedentarize the empire’s nomadic communities.</i></p>

  <p><i>Arguing that a vast body of historical and sociological literature on the Iranian Revolution has been inattentive to the critical role of race, the paper aims to account for the racialization of the revolutionary movement before and after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. Contextualizing its complex, contradictory, and entangled modern history, it is argued that the publicization and politicization of race as a discursive category played a significant role in the revolutionary mobilization that resulted in the overthrowing of the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran. Even though initially appropriated by the Pahlavi monarchy as the state technique to manufacture the regime’s legitimization besides serving its quasi-secular modernization agenda, race, albeit covertly and in a concealed mode, was then counter-mobilized into the liberatory episteme of revolution as formulated and exemplified by its grand ideologues such as Ali Shariati, and finally weaponized against the Pahlavi monarchism. Such a racialization of the revolutionary movement was itself premised upon a refashioning of the interconnected histories of the national Persian and transnational Islamic traditions as well as their intertwined collective memories. Shedding a light on its critical role before and during the Iranian revolution, the paper will subsequently make a case for the ensuing mutations of race and its discursive shifts after the 1979 revolution as it underwent a de-racialization and re-racialization transformations while it retained its mobilizing possibilities by reshaping its liberatory discourses in different post-revolutionary spaces and times.</i></p>

  <p><i>In recent years, postcolonial scholarship has probed the relationship between European- derived theory and non-European histories of the modern world. In particular, postcolonial historians of the Middle East have critiqued the limits and inadequacies of Eurocentric theory presumed to be universal. They have concluded that we cannot simply universalize from European-derived theories and concepts, and speculate that the existing theories of capital, labor, class, race, sexuality, and secularity—to name some—apply with the same characteristics in the Middle East. Following this developing literature, I focus on a particular set of social theory (secularization) and its application to a specific case of historical difference (Iranian history). In existing Iranian studies historiography, the concept of secularization is often invoked, but without a careful accounting of its explanatory value (or lack thereof). I argue that secularization theory, as it stands in the social theory canon, confounds more than it clarifies when tested against modern Iranian historical transformations. Primarily, the differentiation and privatization aspects of secularization theories fail to adequately explain modern Iranian history. However, I further argue that theories of secularization are not without utility. Primary Persian sources of the twentieth century show that the cognition of religion as an autonomous category of analysis became possible. They further demonstrate that the emergent concept of “religion” became, at least for certain demographics, less central to social and individual life. The critique of secularization in an Iranian context may entice comparative conversations with the rest of the Middle East where the decline of religion occurred in different ways compared to Europe.</i></p>

  <p><i>This study focuses on gender in the cultural history of Iranian vocal music during the Pahlavi period. From the early Pahlavi period until the late 1940s and early 1950s, women prolifically performed two kinds of vocal music, namely āvāz and rhythmic vocal music known as Tasnif and Tarāneh. The period under Reza Shah witnessed an eventful era during which female performers appeared publicly. The same generation of female performers continued to perform both vocal performances throughout the 1940s and the early 1950s. However, as this article argues, as women were seen and heard publicly, the masculine elite musical culture reacted to their presence by deploying a gendered discourse in the 1950s and 1960s. The gender dichotomy in the performance of vocal music in Iran, as the article argues, should be read as the history of the opposition between two senses: sight and seeing and ear and listening. While disciplined practices of listening, ear, and body constituted the elite masculine culture, the feminine culture was expressed through public spectacles of sight. Scholarly writings on modern Iranian cultural history have not paid attention to the histories of senses, including the eye and sight and the ear and listening. This article hopes to situate the debates about the performance of vocal music at the cusp of the opposition between the aural and the visual in modern Iranian cultural history and open up a space for writing the history of senses in modern Iranian cultural history.</i></p>

  <p><i>This paper focuses on the way that memories of homeland and journeys of exile are constructed by those in the modern-day Iraqi Jewish diaspora, and how these narratives work to both enrich and obscure the historical record. Nostalgia, performativity, and the fallibility of memory all contribute to creating narratives that differ from both each other and factual history. I examine these issues through self-published memoirs, oral history, and structured informal memory books created by my own relatives. By doing this, I add to the body of critical literature surrounding memoir and family narratives by using original family texts that have not been studied before. These texts are compared with each other to analyze the reasons behind any differences in the recollections of their experiences, and are also situated within the wider body of twentieth-century Iraqi-Jewish exile and emigrant discourse. The contextualization that this paper provides for the primary sources of family narratives also involves the analysis of how such narratives are formed and maintained, situating the paper in anthropological debates around the construction of memory and autobiography. There is no “typical” Iraqi-Jewish narrative, and this paper does not aim to try and capture the totality of Iraqi-Jewish experiences; instead, by focusing on one family and the two narratives of life and emigration that have been recorded, this paper provides a framework for analysis of family narratives within an historical context. In doing so, I aim to demonstrate the paradox of the fallibility of memory, and the usefulness of accounts of life stories in supplementing the historical record.</i></p>

  <p><i>For many generations, differing ethnic and religious communities have cohabitated in modern- day Tunisia. Archaeological evidence shows that Jews have held a long history in the region of North Africa, outlasting the multiple transformations Tunisia endured. The expanding colonial presence in Tunisia during the 20th century led to the rise of a national struggle for internal autonomy. Until 1952, the Jews were not affected by political developments that arose from the independence movement against the French. However, in the summer of 1952, attacks on Jewish homes and property occurred. What was the cause of these attacks? Were the attacks apolitical and spontaneous? Or were they a result of the nationalist opposition movement that exploded throughout the country, where Jews were often accused of collaborating with the French colonists? While emigration to Israel from Tunisia was a complex matter, around 70% of the Jewish population left after independence in 1956. Today, the Jewish population in Tunisia still exists, numbering around 2,000 individuals. Why did some Jews stay when the vast majority of their population emigrated? This paper aims to explore Tunisian Jewish identity during this tumultuous time, when the anti-colonial nationalist movement overtook Tunisian politics, and when Israeli-led Zionist sentiments infiltrated the Jewish community of North Africa. This paper will contribute to the generation of scholars that have begun to tackle and further understand the complexities of the Jewish experience in the Muslim world.</i></p>
