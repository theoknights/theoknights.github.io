<p class="last-paragraph"> Reflecting on her experience as a writer in the Institute for Palestine Studies' ‘How to write your Nakba story?’ workshop, Marah Abdel Jaber will co-lead this lecture and discussion with the writing workshop’s organizer Laura Albast, to share a practical guide on documenting family narratives, oral history collection tools, and journalism's role in generating access to personal histories. Focusing on the experience of the Nakba as a canon of violent fragmentation of Palestinian society, the presenters will also discuss the impact of narrative as a producer of the Palestinian collective conscience.</p>


<p class="last-paragraph"> Please note, this is a hybrid event—Marah will join us in person while Laura will speak on zoom. Those beyond the University of Chicago campus are welcome to register for the webinar <a href= 'https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_spwcj4R0TceIRl444bx2Hg'>here</a>.</p>
