			    <h3>A NELC Genealogy</h3>
This page was inspired by the now defunct <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20160309103012/https://modern-tabaqat.wikia.com/wiki/Modern_Tabaqat_Wikia'>Modern Tabaqat Wikia</a> and the Academic Family Tree project, to create a visual representation of academic lineages in Middle Eastern and particularly Ottoman studies.   
<br>
<h4>A Note on Methodology</h4>
The basis of the data presented here was scraped from the Modern Tabaqat Wikia and supplemented with information drawn from the University of Chicago's NELC Department website my own research into the Ottomanists at one time affiliated with it. It therefore contains an undeniable bias towards individuals educated or working in Euro-American academic institutions, especially UChicago, and towards Ottoman historians. While I've done my best to correct mistakes introduced when scraping the html undoubtedly some persist, please excuse any errors. 
<br>
<br>
For the sake of visual clarity, for students graduating in the last five (or so) decades, where a good deal of information is available online or via ProQuest, links are mostly shown between an advisee and those individuals identified as their primary PhD advisor(s). For earlier advisees I have taken a laxer approach to intellectual genealogy including any individuals identified as important educators in their lives whether by festschrifts or biographical articles.
<br>
<br>
All this said, I think a lot of interesting and surprising connections <code>&#8212;</code> and perhaps even intellectual debts or affinities <code>&#8212;</code> are revealed by looking at a visual representation of these relationships. The full visualization of the data is a bit unwieldy, so I focus below on a few of the more interesting academic lineages related to UChicago. However, the full genealogical tree is available in a word searchable <a href="http://localhost:4000/pdfs/tabaqatbest.pdf">pdf</a> and also as an interactive display at the bottom of the page (NB: You will likely need to refresh the page at least once to get it to appear). 
<br>

<i>The longest genealogy (Image expands when clicked)</i>
</div>
The longest continual lineage currently found in the data stretches from a number of contemporary scholars of Ottoman history and literature back to two 18th century individuals. The first is Johann David Michaelis (1717-1791) a biblical scholar and teacher of Semitic philology who completed his doctorate in 1739 at the University of Halle before becoming a professor at the University of Göttingen. While Michaelis appears to have studied Arabic, there is little to link him to an enduring tradition of scholarship on the Ottoman Empire. 
<br><br>
The other parent of this particular lineage, Denis Dominique Cardonne (1721-1783), is far more promising in this regard. Although he lacked formal academic training, he was one of the "jeunes de langue," taken to Istanbul at the age of nine to train in Turkish and Persian in order to act as a dragoman for the French embassy. He eventually returned to Paris where he became a chair of Ottoman Turkish and Persian at the Collège royal. Whether it was Cardonne himself or his one-time assistant Étienne Le Grand who trained the famous Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy in Turkish is unclear to me, but from this point on the intellectual lineage, through a web of Germanic scholarly institutions, is clearer and an interest in the texts and histories of the Islamic world a consistent theme. While the dominance of German philologists and historians in this lineage is fairly unsurprising given that at least one current professor received their training in Germany, that they should share common "academic ancestors" with a number of prominent Ottomanists in the UK is more remarkable.
